Framework used: Selenium with java, testNG on a Maven Project consuming internet dependencies
through a pom. file in xml format. Using Eclipse IDE and Chrome as a browser through a chrome
Driver file.

This is a project in Eclipse IDE and the instruction to execute the Test isâ€¦

1.- The Test Class contains a line (28) to use in windows OS due this has been created in macOS
Only have to change line 28 by 27 to use chrome driver properly.
2.- Is a Maven project cause the environment variables have to be configured about de OS and the
Java also.
3.- Think that the chrome driver is executable to macOS so that depends of the extension of the file
4.- This Project use a POM.
